# 👋 Hi, I'm Hamza Kheiri

I'm a software developer passionate about building **clean, performant, and maintainable backends**.  
I enjoy solving complex data problems, automating workflows, and improving developer productivity through well-structured code.

## 💻 About Me
- 🧠 Strong in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, with experience in REST API design and JWT-based authentication.  
- ⚙️ Worked with **PostgreSQL**, **Spring Security**, and **Maven** for scalable backend projects.  
- 🌐 Built web tools integrating **React**, **NestJS**, and **Map APIs (Google Maps / Mapbox)**.  
- 🧩 Experienced in data handling and optimization — especially **parsing and processing KML files**.
- 🏗️ Interested in backend architecture, clean code, and performance optimization.

## 🏢 Internship Highlight – *Inwi, Morocco*
During my internship at **Inwi**, I developed an internal web application to:
- Parse, visualize, and sanitize **KML network data**.  
- Calculate distances (client ↔ beacon / client ↔ infrastructure) using **graph algorithms** (like Dijkstra).  
- Create a simple frontend to help non-technical users interact with map data.  

This project improved data accuracy and automation within internal workflows.
